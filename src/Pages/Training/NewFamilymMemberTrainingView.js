                  After La bit my friend, and started becoming snappy with small
                  children, I knew something had to be done. Your lessons with
                  she and I have made a world of difference. I now have
                  confidence that she will behave both at home and out. As you
                  know, she was a very wilful young dog, and while she's now
                  much better behaved, calmer and more confident, she has
                  retained her high spirit and, dare I say, sense of humour.

                  Mutts With Manners has turned around the lives of our family
                  and more importantly, our three dogs. When we came to Maria
                  for help, our youngest dog had been fighting with our older
                  two dogs, who by then were 7 and 8 years old. We were quite
                  convinced that at their age, they would be impossible to
                  change and had resigned ourselves to the likelihood of giving
                  up our youngest dog. From the first session with Maria, we
                  felt an instant confidence that we could work on the behaviour
                  of the dogs to get them back together. Her knowledge and
                  understanding of dogs was instantly clear to us, and as the
                  weeks passed and we saw Maria again, we began to learn more
                  about the dogs than we ever thought possible.

                  Maria has taught us a discipline routine and structure for all
                  three of the dogs that has had the most remarkable by-product
                  – Training of the older two dogs. Neither of our older two
                  dogs had received any training or structure in their lives. At
                  8 and 7 years of age, I didn’t believe the two older dogs
                  could be changed much. Maria has shown us that the opposite is
                  correct.
                  <br />
                  Clients at my art gallery who have known these two dogs since
                  they were pups have seen the transformation that Maria has
                  achieved and are constantly amazed. They regularly tell me
                  that they are like different dogs to the barking, over excited
                  and completely untrained things that used to greet them at the
                  gallery door. Every time a client comments on their new
                  calmness and good behaviour, I think about Maria and her
                  skills to get us where we are today with our dogs.
