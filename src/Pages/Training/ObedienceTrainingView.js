                  Sorry I haven't been in touch, but I have been pretty
                  occupied, settling into our new routine, you know, the stuff
                  you organized with us. We are all getting along famously,
                  since your visits to our house. As you know, us dogs pick up
                  things fairly quickly, and now that my family know how to
                  handle me things are different - it's amazing what your magic
                  did for all of us. Lots of thanks and love.

                  Thankyou for your help in turning Tiana from an unruly little
                  girl into a puppy who is now easier to handle and a pleasure
                  to take for a walk and have around the home. I am amazed at
                  the great improvement in Tiana after only having 2 lessons
                  with you. At one time I thought I would have to put up with a
                  wild uncontrollable dog, but with your assistance in training
                  her this has now all changed. Once again, thank you for all
                  your help and guidance.
