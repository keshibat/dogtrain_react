                  Hi there,I just wanted to thank you for the session with
                  Connie yesterday. Already she is like a different dog! She
                  seems less stressed and is doing as she's told. Also, we
                  didn't have to block off the bedroom last night and she made
                  no attempt to enter! See you next week.

                  Hi Maria, thank you again for your help with Prudie, our
                  French Bulldog. I went from being out of my depth as a
                  first-time dog owner to feeling confident in having the right
                  tools and knowledge. Being an aparment dog it's so important
                  for her to know how to behave - it's great to know you're
                  there for us!
