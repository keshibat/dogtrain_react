                  We made various attempts to take Indie to puppy training
                  school where the classes were more like a battle with our dog
                  as opposed to an enjoyable learning experience. Then we were
                  very happy to meet you and join together to train our
                  beautiful new pup. Your advice and assistance in training was
                  comparable to none and the difference in the behaviour of
                  Indie was noticeable in 2 weeks. We look forward to seeing you
                  soon. Thanks again.

                  I would like to start with a big Thank You. Misty and I really
                  enjoyed puppy training. We learnt so much and lots of great
                  tips. What I liked is I felt I could talk to you and ask you
                  anything and you had great advice to help us through.
