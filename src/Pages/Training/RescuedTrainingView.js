                  As you know Muttley had become a pain that I nearly had him
                  put to sleep because of his behaviour, biting, digging holes,
                  being aggressive to the other 2 dogs and generally becoming
                  unacceptable. With your guidance, Muttley has now become a
                  good member of our household. Behaving himself, doing as he is
                  told when he is told, being able to groom him, no biting and
                  becoming a little darling. I would recommend you to anyone.

                  To Whom It May Concern We have a 7 year old female Boxer,
                  named Holly that we got from Boxer Rescue NSW, a number of
                  years ago. Holly had been badly treated in the early years of
                  her life, and whilst she had a friendly and affectionate
                  disposition, she also came with a few problems, legacy of how
                  other humans had behaved toward her. We had tried a couple of
                  other dog trainers over the years, and even started watching
                  The Dog Whisperer on Foxtel, to pick up some pointers, but the
                  key problem areas remained. Our main issues were:
                  <br />
                  1. erocious stance and barking when anyone came to the front
                  door. This would continue for a few minutes, until she was
                  able to satisfy herself that the visitors weren’t going to
                  hurt her
                  <br />
                  2. incessant pulling on the lead when being taken for a walk
                  <br />
                  3. not coming when called and easily distracted, so no
                  confidence in being able to let her off her leash in the park
                  <br />
                  4. attacking other dogs that she may encounter on a walk
                  <br />

                  These problems are not immediately obvious when selecting a
                  dog from a rescue organisation or the RSPCA, but tend to
                  emerge as the dog settles into their new home and realises
                  they are no longer going to be hurt or neglected. We found
                  Maria Cunningham, from Mutts with Manners, whilst searching
                  the internet in yet another attempt to find help. Other
                  options we found on the Internet, involved sending our dog
                  away for 2 weeks intensive training. We were not prepared to
                  do that and had heard one or two horror stories from others
                  that had. The difference with Maria, is that she comes to our
                  home and the dog’s surroundings, so that she can witness first
                  hand, the problem areas and determine the remedial actions
                  that are required.

                  Maria was able to tell us what we were doing wrong, and help
                  us change our behaviours, to obtain the behaviours in Holly
                  that we require. After four sessions of dog training, spaced
                  two weeks apart, we are well on our way. Walking Holly is a
                  delight and we have made significant steps in the other areas
                  as well. For us it is now continued practice and ensuring
                  consistency in approach. Maria is always at the end of the
                  phone or email to provide additional pointers and assistance.
                  And of course if we feel that we need another session, she
                  will be there too. We, and Holly can highly recommend Maria to
                  assist with dog (and people) behavioural issues
