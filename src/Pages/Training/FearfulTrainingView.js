                  <strong>Dear Maria</strong>
                  <br />
                  Fiona and I want to extend our warm thanks and gratitude for
                  your help with training Peggy (and us!). As you know Peggy
                  (the 2½ year old Fox Terrier X) caused us some concern when we
                  first rescued her. We found her rather timid and submissive
                  and we were troubled by her jumping up, mouthing, and some
                  other undesirable behaviours. We found it most valuable and
                  cost effective to have you consult with us on a one-to-one
                  basis and we were delighted with the results after the first
                  dog training session.

                <div className="message-body">
                  We now have a dog that is much more confident and obedient,
                  primarily because we are more confident and consistent with
                  her. We feel that we have managed to achieve these results
                  because you were able to quickly identify the remedial action
                  that was needed and give us clear and easy to apply
                  instructions. Once again, very many thanks and we would
                  recommend you and your approach to anyone seeking help with
                  training their dog.
