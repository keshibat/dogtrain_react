                  Originally an old miner's cottage, Schatzi's on Shalimah is
                  fully renovated and perfect as a quiet, couple's weekender. At
                  a small extra cost, however, the second bedroom can be made
                  available for a small group seeking a Hunter getaway. The
                  large yard is fully enclosed with lovely lawns and shading
                  trees for both pets and owners to while away their time when
                  not busy sampling the wares of the many nearby wineries and
                  flourishing culinary outlets.

                  A lovely park is just a minute's walk away with Vincent Street
                  (the hub of the town) within 5 minutes walk. Here you can
                  enjoy breakfast or just a coffee at one of the many dog
                  friendly cafes.

                  Schatzi was our German Shepherd who loved to explore and run
                  which the big land size allows. Named in her honour it's a
                  very rare property in that your beloved pets are most welcome
                  inside when you're there to supervise with throws provided
                  should you choose to have them on the furniture with you.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When you're not at home and if you choose not to take them
                  with you, the large fenced yard gives them room to play and,
                  if you feel that they might be determined diggers or fence
                  climbers (the fences are 150-180cm high all around) they can
                  always be left in the 'doggy space' within the house, safe and
                  sound until you return. Inside
