              Before our dog trainers visit you, send a note out to ALL of your
              neighbours asking for information on your dogs’ barking – what
              time your dog barks, how long he's barking for for, what it sounds
              like (sad, angry, bored, etc) - is your puppy whining as well?.
              This way when we start working with you in dog training, we have a
              clear picture of your dog’s behaviour patterns.

            <p className="is-size-6-desktop">
              Sometimes dogs jump up because they want to show how important
              they are in the pack, but often we are encouraging our dogs to
              jump up without even knowing it!! When you work with us we’ll be
              able to show you exactly how you’re confusing your dog and maybe
              giving him mixed signals. And if you’re not going to breed from
              your dog, desexing him is a very good idea.

              My dog is aggressive to other dogs. Do you have group training for

            </h3>
            <p className="is-size-6-desktop">
              When there is dog aggression to other dogs, it’s often because
              he’s fearful – putting him into a group of dogs will probably make
              this worse rather than better. When you start working with us we
              won’t be around other dogs until you have more control over your
              dog (dog obedience training will also be part of this), and he’s
              feeling more confident – then he’ll be playing at the park in no
              time!

            <p className="is-size-6-desktop">
              A puppy who digs will usually turn into an adult dog who digs
              unless you teach him not to. Puppy training covers all puppy
              basics and dog obedience training but we also cover ‘problem
              behaviours’ and put a lot of preventative stuff in place so that
              he won’t even discover the joys of digging or chewing!

            <p className="is-size-6-desktop">
              A dog is never too old to learn but it can take them a little

              Many dogs live outside and never need to learn to be toilet
              trained. As with any older dog, take that little bit more time
              with toilet training and he’ll turn out just like new!
