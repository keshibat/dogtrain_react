                      Mutts with Manners’ chief instructor, Maria Cunningham,
                      has been a professional dog obedience trainer since 1993.
                      This position of Assistant Trainer at Sydney Community
                      College in Leichhardt entailed running the group dog
                      training classes - some of the first group dog training
                      classes to be professionally run in Sydney!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Although Maria had done obedience training with the
                      family’s dogs throughout her childhood, her intense
                      involvement in the training of horses in the 1980s taught
                      her the skills that are now considered ‘revolutionary’ in
                      the dog training world – motivational training. This is
                      also where "Dog Whispering" first started.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Through her ongoing study of dogs, dog training methods,
                      dog behaviour, dog desensitisation techniques, and other
                      professional obedience training methods, combined with the
                      lessons taught to her by horses, Maria developed her own
                      ‘Think Dog’ methodology. Humans are supposed to be the
                      superior species after all so why shouldn’t we learn the
                      dog's language! This gentle psychological method banishes
                      the harsh methods previously used in dog and puppy
                      training, instead giving owners a new insight into their
                      dogs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Maria is also the author of "Ruling The Roost - What Your
                      Dog REALLY Wants You To Know!" available through our
                      'Training Aids' page and also via Amazon as an e-book.
